In analyzing the Marxian theory of social evolution, M. M. Bober closely examines the writings of Marx and his friend, Friedrich Engels, tracing the formulation of the doctrine in Capital, The Poverty of Philosophy, Civil War in France, Revolution and Counter-Revolution, The Communist Manifesto, and other of their voluminous publications. By careful, objective investigation, the author is able to present an accurate interpretation of Marx’s economic and historical concepts, and he evaluates the theory in the light of actual historical development.<br />In the extensive revision of his authoritative study, Bober has taken full account of developments since its first publication. Unknown writings by Marx and Engels recently have been discovered; new voices have been raised in defense of and against Marxian concepts; and economic theory has changed, with the problems of the business cycle and economic calculation assuming greater prominence. Bober’s critical analysis of Marx and of his influence make a valuable and timely book, of interest not merely to scholars but also to everyone who is stirred to serious reading by the present conflict of political ideologies.""<br />(Description from publisher)","Marx, Karl; History — Philosophy","Marxist Literature","","","Text","application/pdf","eng","© 1948, President and Fellows of Harvard College","http://rightsstatements.org/vocab/InC/1.0/","pdf","https://drive.google.com/file/d/1J5CmffXVp483rt_36HHXf_Dpz2ZMsYok/preview","/objects/small/karl-marx-s-interpretation-of-history-1950_small.jpg","/objects/thumbs/karl-marx-s-interpretation-of-history-1950_thumb.jpg"

Throughout their highly personal conversations recorded here, Horton and Freire discuss the nature of social change and empowerment and their individual literacy campaigns. The ideas of these men developed through two very different channels: Horton's, from the Highlander Center, a small, independent residential education center situated outside the formal schooling system and the state; Freire's, from within university and state-sponsored programs.<br />Myles Horton, who died in January 1990, was a major figure in the civil rights movement and founder of the Highlander Folk School, later the highlander Research and Education Center. Paulo Freire, author of Pedagogy of the Oppressed, established the Popular Culture Movement in Recife, Brazil's poorest region, and later was named head of the New National Literacy Campaign until a military coup forced his exile from Brazil. He has been active in educational development programs worldwide.<br />For both men, real liberation is achieved through popular participation. The themes they discuss illuminate problems faced by educators and activists around the world who are concerned with linking participatory education to the practice of liberation and social change. How could two men, working in such different social spaces and times, arrive at similar ideas and methods? These conversations answer that question in rich detail and engaging anecdotes, and show that, underlying the philosophy of both, is the idea that theory emanates from practice and that knowledge grows from and is a reflection of social experience."" <br />(Description from publisher)","Education — Philosophy; Adult education — Social aspects; Education — Social aspects; Social change","Marxist Literature","","","Text","application/pdf","eng","© 1990, Highlander Research and Education Center","http://rightsstatements.org/vocab/InC/1.0/","pdf","https://drive.google.com/file/d/1d1aJ3mGmzHFhg3P1QgLIIKROopOioISX/preview","/objects/small/we-make-the-road-by-walking-conversations-on-education-and-social-change-1990_small.jpg","/objects/thumbs/we-make-the-road-by-walking-conversations-on-education-and-social-change-1990_thumb.jpg"
